Extras:

1. MVC  - chose to implement leaderboard with MVP for separation of components because the screen as more than basic popup show implmentation , thus separation of logic and view are suggested.

2. Requires level system and level assets architecture    designing for abstraction, good challenge.

5. Nice challenge.

6. Present data managment.

I didnâ€™t much time for proper UI, SFX VFX/Animations basically art stuff which requires more time, I can do this if it is preferable, I do deal those manners on daily basis work.
